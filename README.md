Black Hole Simulation
This project is a visualization of a black hole simulation created using OpenGL and ImGui. The shader is sourced from Shadertoy and has been adapted to work within an OpenGL environment.

Features
Visualization of black holes and their gravitational effects.
Realistic visuals powered by shaders.
User interaction through ImGui interface.
Dynamic visualization and simulation control through user settings.
Technologies Used
OpenGL: Main rendering technology for 3D graphics.
ImGui: Minimalistic and fast user interface solution.
GLFW: Window creation and input handling.
GLM: Mathematics library for vector and matrix computations.
Shader (Shadertoy): Shader code responsible for simulating the black hole.
Getting Started
Requirements
OpenGL driver (minimum version 4.5 recommended)
GLFW, GLM, and ImGui libraries
C++ 11 or higher
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone <repository_link>
Install the required dependencies (GLFW, GLM, ImGui).

Build the project:

Use CMake or another suitable build system to compile the project.
Run the application:

Launch the main.cpp to start the simulation.
Usage
Upon launching the application, a black hole visualization will appear on the screen.
The ImGui-based interface allows you to customize the simulation and adjust settings.
Use the ImGui menu to control the camera and other simulation parameters.
