# Black Hole Simulation

This project visualizes a black hole simulation using OpenGL and ImGui. The shader code has been sourced from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsBXW3) and adapted for use in an OpenGL environment to create realistic visual effects and simulations.

## Screenshots

Here are some example screenshots of the simulation:

## Features

- Simulates the gravitational effects around a black hole.
- Realistic black hole visuals created with shaders.
- Interactive user interface using ImGui for controlling the simulation.
- Dynamic visualization with adjustable simulation parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenGL**: The primary rendering technology for 3D graphics.
- **ImGui**: Lightweight and fast user interface solution.
- **GLFW**: Used for window creation and input handling.
- **GLM**: Mathematics library for vector and matrix computations.
- **Shader (Shadertoy)**: Shader code responsible for simulating the black hole.
